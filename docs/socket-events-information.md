# Socket events

These are the socket events that are used by the server to communicate with the client.

## Sensors events

These are events to have updated information about the sensors in general, taking into account that a single sensor can have multiple sensors embedded in it.

| Key             | Description                                                                | Type |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| system-registered-sensors | Emits an object with the data of the registered sensors in the system, with the following format: `data: { sensor1: true, sensor2: false }`, where the boolean indicates if the sensor is streaming data or is inactive. | Generated by the server |
| system-registered-sensors | Emits the event without payload | Generated by the client |

## Temperature events

| Key             | Description                                                                | Type |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| temperature-cache-data-update-{sensorId} | Emits an object with the data of the last temperature registries with the respective dates of the cache, these number are set in the temperature service in the MAX_CACHE_SIZE variable. | Generated by the server |
| temperature-registered-sensors | Emits an object with the registered temperature sensors with the following format: `data: [...]` where the sensors are inside an array | Generated by the server |
| temperature-data | Emits an event with a payload containing the id of the sensor sensors, awaits the 'response' of the last cached data | Generated by the client |
